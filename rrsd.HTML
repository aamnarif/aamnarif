</center>These School Rules must be fully respected in order to allow us all to live together in harmony and promote, with everyone’s conscious effort, true autonomy.<br>

</center><br><b><u><h3>Absences</h3></u></b><br>
It is required of students to regularly attend all classes scheduled for their grade, as well as, the activities chosen at the beginning of the year. Punctuality is a primary rule to observe.
The administration must be informed of any absence by 12:30p.m. that same day. Also, in order to be admitted into class, the student must present to his teacher (elementary school) or the school life office (secondary school) a letter from his/her parents justifying his/her absence.
After 3 consecutive days absent, the student must provide a medical certificate attesting that the return of the student involves no contagious risk.
<br><br>

<b><u><h3>Student Dress and Conduct</h3></u></b><br>
Students must come to the school in proper attire. If this basic rule is not observed, the principal or his representative reserves the right to refuse entry to any student. 
A polite attitude and use of proper language are expected from students towards all school personnel, their friends and any person met in the school or its immediate area.
<br>

Students must be responsible for the cleanliness of the school (picking up in the classrooms, corridors, etc.).
Particular attention, starting at the youngest age, must be given to respecting school furniture, property and supplies left at the disposal of students. Damage done intentionally to the grounds or due to the improper use of equipment will warrant disciplinary action, and parents will be held financially responsible for repairs. Students must keep track of their belongings (books, clothes, lunch boxes, etc., and not let them lie around in the hallways.
Parents are strongly advised to put name tags on their children’s belongings. Lost and found items must be claimed. The school cannot be held responsible for the exchange, loss or theft of objects or money belonging to students.
<br><br>

<b><u><h3>School Rules</h3></u></b>

<br><b>Punctuality</b><br>
It is important to arrive to class on time in order to take full advantage of the school day, and, in particular, not to upset the work of others and the concentration of classmates who arrived at the proper time.
School rules must be respected by the whole school. In this way, we can benefit from a school with an excellent atmosphere in which to study and enjoy ourselves.<br><br>
