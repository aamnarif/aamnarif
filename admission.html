<li>Admissions Policy 
DPS has developed a strict policy for the admissions based on the principles of transparency and fairness, for which purpose the School’s admissions committee collectively reviews cases and selects students. Without discrimination, DPS welcomes girls from all communities and religions, with only merit as the sole criterion for admission. 
</p>Admission tests are conducted between Jan-Feb every year in Pre-Nursery and Nursery classes.
<li><div align="justify"><b>Age limit for candidates :</b>
<li><b><div align="justify"> Pre-Nursery</b> is 2 years to 2.4 years</li></div> 
<li><b> <div align="justify">Nursery</b> is 2.7 years to 3.3 years</div></ul>
<p><br>Note:Birth certificate issued in the past 6 months are not acceptable.
Evaluation is conducted on the basis of testing the children and interviewing the parents. The proportion of weightage given to the test and the interview are as follows:
</br><ul>
<li><div align="justify"><b>In Class Pre-Nursery </b></div></li> <li><div align="justify">Interview: 60% </div></li> <li><div align="justify">Test: 40%</div></li> 
<li><div align="justify"><b>In Class Nursery </b></div></li> <li><div align="justify">Interview : 25% </div></li> <li><div align="justify">Test: 75% </div></li> <p>Prospective candidates will be informed of the test results after a period of four weeks from the time of evaluation through phone, SMS and/or letter. All decisions regarding the selection of students is made by a panel and are considered final.

<li>Admission Procedure (Pre-Nursery and Nursery)

Registration for new admissions continues for three days. The dates for registration are announced early in January every year and are displayed on Dawood Public School website. For the convenience of the parents, separate counters for Pre-Nursery and Nursery are set up. The staff on the counters ensures that the requisite documents are complete and in order, after which they issue a token. The parents are seated in the designated waiting areas to wait for the announcement of the number on the token. They then proceed to the data entry room for registration. The room is equipped with workstations dedicated for entering the credentials of the candidates and their parents into a central database by using a custom-built online software system, while admit cards are printed and issued to the parents. 
After the data entry, the parents are given a printed form to review the data and sign it. The form is submitted along with the required documents at the clearance counter. The counter, after receiving registration fee, issues a Clearance Slip/Admit Card which contains the date and time for the test and interview.
For the convenience of those who wish to fill in the registration form before, we are uploaded the form in our website. Please download the form and bring the completed form along with documents for registration. (Incomplete registration forms will not be accepted).
