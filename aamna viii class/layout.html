Dawood Public School</h1></a>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>

<p>To develop an educational institution that produces young women who possess the capabilities of critical thinking,
 analysis and awareness of disparate environments. They will be instilled with knowledge and acumen to enable them to 
 become proactive members of their culture and society, as well as to equip them with the practical tools necessary for
  their survival and autonomy. Every student of Dawood Public School will be nurtured to explore and cultivate her 
  aptitudes, interests and skills. The School’s vision is to expand this ethos to include all people associated with 
  the institution so as to create a ‘learning community’. A communal network whose members will be worthy role models 
  for others; confident, well rounded, possessing values of integrity and sensitivity to the plight of others, common 
  sense and recognition of their position and their roles amongst their families and in the development of their Country.</p>
